## TODO
- If you hold ESC it should clear Key selected.
- check if column dropdown is column aware
---
- PRETTIFY ACTION DROP DOWN

- Please explain to me how haptics works in the framework. Is this portable to windows in any way? Do you think it would be possible to implement in windows by reverse engineering?

### Gesture config:
- Create dropdown for each of my gestures and implement them as actions that can be selected from a drop down. (You can reference ../windows/glasstokey if you need!)
- Left / Right / Double Click actions in Action Dropdown
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load global.json default
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
# HUGE:

- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- "Autosplay" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
